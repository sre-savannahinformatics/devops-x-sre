# Social Media Challenge

Welcome to the Social Media Challenge repository! This project is a simple web application built with Django, designed to create posts for different users (A social media app*).

## Background

Our infrastructure consists of a mix of local and cloud-deployed resources, primarily using Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. We utilize a combination of virtual machines and containerized services. The stack is dominated by open-source tools and frameworks, with a Linux-based server fleet, a preference for Ubuntu/Debian, and deployment automation through Ansible.

The majority of our systems are implemented in Python and Go. Our CI/CD pipeline relies on a self-hosted Gitlab instance and Gitlab CI. Monitoring is achieved using StatsD and Grafana, and PostgreSQL serves as our primary database, with occasional usage of Oracle or SQL Server when interacting with clientsâ€™ systems. We expose REST and GraphQL APIs, consumed by single-page frontend apps and mobile apps. NGINX reverse proxies typically secure these APIs, except for Go services, which may be exposed directly.

## Challenge
